        <p>The first thing I wanted to change was the way the header and nav were setup. There isn't really a obvious way to see the name of the site, so I moved the heading and added a title other than on the small image, making it obvious what site you're on and that it's the homepage. The other thing I didnt like about the orginal site was that the nav is very small, very clustered, and not that intuitive. I cut most of the links, and left the most used, and most important ones. Leaving the others links for other places. I also added a few image quick links onto the side for a quick way to those pages without a home.</p>
        
        <h2>Difference 2</h2>

        <p>Probably the biggest change, was changing how the main content was displayed. The before displays an unorganized display, with no visual hierchy, that only shows of parts of what the website can be used for, forgetting other categories. I made these much cleaner, moved some to another section, and kept a recurring theme between the main 6 six sections of the site. I also changed some content, getting rid of the curators choice and recent review, due to how little relevance they had, opting for recent posts and quick links instead.</p>
        
        <h2>Difference 3</h2>

        <p>I took the small and easy to miss About and Anouncement sections and put them below the main content of the homepage. Not everyone who just wants to use the site cares about these sections, and its a very easy scroll for a newcomer to find these and know where they are. I also took some links from the nav and moved them to the About section, because they are more relevant to that information, stuff like donating and volunteering is something an everyday user wants to have to sift through when using the website.</p>
        
        <h2>Difference 4</h2>

        <p>I completely removed the most recent post section. The scope of the site is too big to collect all the most recent posts together. It's hardly relevant to every user, and is usually overflowed by the Grateful Dead archive. That should be on each pages specific home page. I increased the size of institutional support to make them a little more prominent, and gave the footer a little more presence also to make the page look a little bit sleeker.</p>
        
        <h2>Difference 5</h2>

        <p>A lot of things I did were just general changes to the site. The color scheme has some slight changes to it, in an attempt to keep most of the color of the original site, while still trying to make it look like a more modern website. The quick links on the side of the nav are intended for niche use, and the GD logo is there because one of the biggest use of the site is GD Concerts, and I think it deserves its on quick link. The logo fits nicer on the other side of th page. All of the html has been rewritten as well. Before it was located in a series of tables, an ancient practice. It's now freshly coded using the correct html containers.</p>
